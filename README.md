# Events
The user can create and sign up to an event. After signing up, if the event date is close to the current date, the user will be notified. The event notification system
uses a separate thread that from time to time checks if the logged user has signed up to an event, so that he will be notified during runtime and not only after he
logs. Also, the user can disable notifications for upcomming events.

The application can save these reports in a pdf file by clicking on the "Save as" button. A "Save as" dialog window will be opened where the user can select the 
location of the file. For the implementation we used apache pdfbox library. Bellow you can see an example for each type of report.

# Implementation Details
The application is based on a layered architecture as follows: Domain (models and validators), Repository (for persistence), Services (which use the persistence layer 
and implement the business rules of the application), JavaFx Controlllers and Views (MVC pattern).

The data is persisted on a local Postgresql database. The communication with the database is managed only through the repository which implement a common interface,
so the business rules will not change if the persistence details change.

The owner of the database is postgres. Connection details regarding url, user and password can be configured in the config.properties resource file.

Bellow is the script for generating the database:

# Prerequisites
Gradle build system for Java
Postgresql server for local database
